# Research Sources & Execution Strategy

## Source Hierarchy
1. **Primary sources** (papers, official announcements)
2. **Practitioner analysis** (blogs from builders)
3. **Aggregated discourse** (HN, technical communities)
4. **Social signals** (major announcements only)

---

## Filtering Criteria

### High-Value Signals
- Novel techniques with empirical validation
- Production deployment patterns and lessons
- Benchmark breakthroughs (>10% improvement on established metrics)
- Framework/tool releases with traction
- Contradictions to established understanding
- Strategic inflection points

### Low-Value Noise
- Incremental improvements (<5% gains)
- Hype without substance
- Derivative commentary
- Pure speculation
- Marketing disguised as content

---

## Quality Filters

### For Research Papers (arXiv)
- Papers from known labs (Anthropic, OpenAI, DeepMind, Google Research, Meta AI, Stanford, Berkeley)
- Papers with code repositories
- Novel methods (not just new datasets)
- Reproducible results

### For Blog Posts
- Author credibility (practitioners, researchers)
- Depth of analysis (not surface-level)
- Novel insights or framing
- Production experience sharing

### For Hacker News
- Score > 100 points
- Technical substance in discussion
- Not just reaction/opinion
- Top comments add value
