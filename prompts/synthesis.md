# Daily Digest Synthesis Template

## Output Format

Use this exact structure for the digest:

```markdown
---
date: {YYYY-MM-DD}
type: research-digest
tags: [research, ai, daily-digest, {auto-generated-tags}]
sources: [{source_count}]
items: [{item_count}]
---

# AI Research Digest - {Weekday}, {Month} {Day}, {Year}

## TL;DR

{2-3 sentence summary of the day's most significant developments. Focus on:
1. The single most important advancement or trend
2. Any paradigm shifts or contradictions to previous understanding
3. Practical implications for AI transformation work}

---

## Key Developments

{For each theme, use this structure:}

### {Theme Name}
{1-sentence theme introduction}

#### {Item Title}
**Source**: [{Source Name}]({URL}) · {Author} · {Date}

{2-3 sentence description covering:}
- **What**: Core contribution or finding
- **How**: Method or approach (if technical)
- **Why it matters**: Implication for AI practitioners/researchers

**Tags**: `{tag1}` `{tag2}` `{tag3}`

---

{Repeat for each item, grouped by theme}

---

## Signals & Patterns

### Rising Signals
{Topics gaining momentum - 2-3 items max}
- **{Topic}**: {Why it's emerging now}

### Worth Watching
{Weak signals that might matter later - 1-2 items}
- **{Topic}**: {Why it's on the radar}

---

## Additional Reading

{2-3 items that didn't make the main digest but are worth tracking}

1. **{Title}** - [{Source}]({URL})
   {1-sentence description}

## Synthesis Instructions

### Thematic Grouping
Organize items by conceptual theme, NOT by source. Group related items together even if they're from different sources.

### Writing Guidelines

**Clarity**
- Use active voice
- Avoid jargon unless necessary (define when used)
- Prefer concrete examples over abstract descriptions

**Precision**
- Cite specific numbers (benchmark scores, parameters, etc.)
- Use exact terminology from source
- Don't hedge unnecessarily ("likely", "possibly" → only if actually uncertain)

**Concision**
- Maximum 3 sentences per item description
- No redundant phrasing
- Every word must earn its place

**Context**
- Connect to previous work ("builds on", "contradicts", "extends")
- Note implications for practitioners
- Flag open questions or limitations

### Metadata Extraction

For each item, include:
- **Source**: Publication venue or blog name
- **Author**: If notable (paper authors, blog author)
- **Date**: Publication date
- **Tags**: Auto-generate based on content (e.g., "multi-agent", "rlhf", "benchmark")

### Quality Control

Before finalizing:
1. Verify all URLs are accessible (from the data provided)
2. Check that themes have 2+ items (merge or split if needed)
3. Ensure TL;DR accurately represents content
4. Confirm no duplicate items
5. Validate that "Why it matters" connects to Lee's work context

### Special Cases

**Major Releases**: If a major model/framework is released, give it prominent placement and explain capabilities/implications

**Contradicting Research**: If papers contradict each other, note this explicitly and explain both positions

**Breaking News**: If something significant happened (acquisition, breakthrough, scandal), address it directly in TL;DR
